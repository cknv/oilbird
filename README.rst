API
---

As far as I understand Gnip does not intend their Historical Powertrack to be used programmatically, so neither do I intend this tool to be used in such a way. I am however sure that it would be possible.

Name
----

The name is taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oilbird which is described as having a primitive echolocation. Which is suitable since command line tools aren't that fancy.

Apparently, there is also something about social media and birds.
